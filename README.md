# Description
I never got into SCP that much in high school, they were cool as a writing project but I wasn't one of the kids into creepypasta type stuff. Not until recently did i appreciate the levels of world building in the series or ARG or well.. what ever the heck SCP is in its latest incantation. SCP 1004 has stuck with me since I first heard about it as a teenager, The idea (amd story) is so simple from an SCP perspective and yet it raises so many questions. It ultimatly ended up that the author was just depraved and possibly using the article as a psudo fantasy setting however I actually enjoyed the idea of the SCP and the implications it had. I only wish it was written with better intentions and at a higher quality standard rather than just simple "shock" value.

With the advent of AI and the lack of regulation in the space I constantly get bombarded with AI hentai and porn ads when i'm looking at less than wholesome sites, To me this feels almost as if SCP 1004 were real. You could type any fantasy into a chat bot and play it out, any sick image that comes to your mind or celebrity you have a crush on could be yours if you only pay a price and are willing to forgo some morality for a bit. The constant ads along with the reminder about 1004 while scrolling reddit inspired me to create this project as a weird nerdy addition to the SCP universe. 

As I don't plan on hosting the website extenrally, it will act as an internal site with simple html links. I plan on updating the functionaly more in the near future, it will have a "functional" search feature that takes users to a "thumbnail" page which shows them dozens of generic vidoe boxes with the titles replaced by their search words. A randomized play count, timer and "universe number" is added to each section to add to the immersion that the videos themselves are real. (In my incantation of the story i beleiev each video or image the user makes is actually a recording from an alternate reality). Once the user clicks on an image or title it takes them to a psudo seizrue image stating the website has been seized by the SCP, their location is tracked and to wait for further instructions.

# Why?
Well it combines a few of my favorite topics currently:
- Social commentary on AI
- Website Seizure images
- Easy coding projects
